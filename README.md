3. Add basic hard-coded dictionary for hit-missed file names to be properly mapped
4. Check existing database with the web to identify missing files (If any)
5. NIL

## Status:
1. Feature done -> Verified to be working
2. Feature done -> Verified to be working
3. Feature done -> Verified to be working
4. In-progress
5. NIL

## Requirements:
